## Portfolio project

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the Task Management Web Application is a simplified version that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks. The key features of the MVP include:
User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their tasks securely.
Task Management: Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. They can create new tasks, view a list of their tasks, update the status or details of a task, and delete tasks.
User Roles: The application supports two user roles - regular users and administrators. Administrators have additional privileges to manage users and tasks.
